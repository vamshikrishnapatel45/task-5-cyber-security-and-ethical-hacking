I’ve successfully completed Task 5 (Capstone & Incident Response) of my ApexPlanet internship — an end-to-end project that ties together reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, detection and response.
Capstone highlights:
📌 Project Scope: Performed a full web app pentest on DVWA/bWAPP and a vulnerability assessment of my test network; documented end-to-end methodology and findings.
🧭 Implementation: Conducted recon, scanning (Nmap/OpenVAS), controlled exploitation, and implemented fixes for discovered issues.
🧾 Incident Response Simulation: Detected a simulated attack in logs, performed containment and eradication steps, and produced a post-incident report with timelines and evidence.
🛠️ SIEM Prototype: Built a mini SIEM (ELK stack) to collect and visualize logs/alerts for simple detection rules.
🎯 Deliverables: Professional report (executive summary, methodology, findings, mitigations), ER/network diagrams, scripts, screenshots, and a 12-minute final presentation video.
